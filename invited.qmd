## Dan Simpson

Machine Learning Engineer, [.txt](https://dottxt.co/)

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}

Dan Simpson worked with Håvard at NTNU from 2010–2014 on INLA, SPDEs, and PC priors. It was very fun. He worked other places later, but they're less important. These days, he lives in New York and thinks a lot about parsers and putting complex constraints on large language models. He has an infrequently updated blog that is probably not advisable to actually read, but has a couple of ok jokes if you're willing to slog through it [(https://dansblog.netlify.app/)](https://dansblog.netlify.app/)

## Andrea Riebler

Professor in Statistics, NTNU, Norway

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}

Andrea Riebler is a Professor of Statistics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim. She earned her Ph.D. in 2010 from the University of Zurich and later held a postdoctoral fellowship there in statistical genomics. Her research focuses on spatial statistics, Bayesian inference, and biostatistical applications. She has led projects funded by the Norwegian Research Council, including work on Penalized Complexity Priors for Bayesian models. Andrea has contributed to developing the INLA software and the R package SUMMER, which focuses on mapping health indicators in low- and middle-income countries.
