---


## Expected Behaviour

All members and participants must maintain a professional, respectful, and productive environment free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Debate is encouraged but must be conducted with professionalism, respect, and courtesy.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Prohibited behaviours include threats, harassment, disrespectful comments or actions targeting personal characteristics (e.g., gender, race, religion, etc.), intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Disorderly or disruptive conduct and violations of event rules are also unacceptable.

These standards apply to all participants. Anyone who experiences, observes, or has knowledge of a violation should bring it to the attention of Daniela Castro-Camilo (daniela.castrocamilo@glasgow.ac.uk).
