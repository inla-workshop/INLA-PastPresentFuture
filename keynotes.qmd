::: {.column width="80%"}

Professor Lindgren's research focuses on spatial and spatio-temporal stochastic models, environmetrics, and computational methods and software. Among many others, he co-authored the influential paper "An Explicit Link Between Gaussian Fields and Gaussian Markov Random Fields: The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Approach," published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B. Professor Lindgren has contributed to the development of several R packages, including INLA for Bayesian latent Gaussian models and inlabru, a user-friendly interface for INLA with additional features.

Sara Martino is Associate Professor of Statistics at NTNU in Norway and previously a researcher at SINTEF Energy AS. Her research interests are Bayesian modeling and spatial and spatio-temporal statistics. She has contributed to various research fields, including ecology, environmental science and survival analysis.
Dr Martino has contributed significantly to the field through various publications. Notably, she co-authored the paper "Approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models by using integrated nested Laplace approximations," published in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B on 2009. This seminal contribution to Bayesian statistics introduces and develops the INLA methodology.
